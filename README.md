## **Real-time Chat System**

The platform includes a **real-time chat** feature that allows students and teachers to communicate instantly. This feature is powered by **Socket.IO**, which facilitates real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between the frontend and backend.

### **Socket.IO Overview**:
- **Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO)**: Manages socket connections and events between users (students, teachers).
- **Frontend (React + Socket.IO Client)**: Allows real-time message exchange, updates the chat UI in real-time.

---

## **System Architecture**

### **High-Level Architecture**
The system consists of:
1. **Frontend (React)**: Interacts with the backend via REST API and Socket.IO, handles routing, and UI rendering.
2. **Backend (Node.js, Express)**: Serves as the API provider, connects to the MongoDB database, handles business logic, and real-time chat through Socket.IO.
3. **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores all user data, courses, exams, submissions, and chat histories.
4. **Cloud Storage (Cloudinary)**: Stores media files such as images and videos uploaded by users.

You can view the full **system diagram** [here in Figma](https://www.figma.com/system-diagram).

### **Database Schema**
The core database entities:
- **Users**: Stores students, teachers, and admins
- **Courses**: Stores course details, syllabus, and materials
- **Exams**: Stores exam details, questions, and answers
- **Submissions**: Student submissions for assignments and exams
- **Messages**: Stores chat messages between users

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/elearning-system.git
cd elearning-system
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**:
```bash
npm run setup-project
```

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<Your Cloudinary Cloud Name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API Key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API Secret>
```

### **4. Run the Project**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently. The real-time chat system will be available once the app is running.
